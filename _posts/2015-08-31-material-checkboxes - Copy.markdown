If you happen to frequent a small corner of the web called Google (found <a href="http://www.google.com">here</a>) you may have noticed that things look a little different today:

Yes, Google has eschewed their iconic serifed emblem for a bolder, more simplified logo. And what better way to evoke messaging for your information company than to use the font which looks like a preschoolers's handwriting?

Following a corporate restructuring under parent company 'Alphabet', Google's new childish logo was unveiled in faux-crayon in their classic building-blocks colours.

One can only wonder what is happening at Google but I thought I'd take a look at this new indictment to typography.

The new insignia erupts with a strong capital 'G' &mdash; a statement that says "Who needs brand recognition when you can replace the most iconic capital letter in history with the Groupon logo?"

Immediately following, and impeccably kerned, stand a couple of lowercase 'o's. A testament to flat design and Illustrator's Circle tool.

Google has forgone their lowercase-yet-dignified lobed '<span style="font-family:serif; font-size:1.2em;">g</span>' for the much simpler 'second-grade kind'. Never had I seen anything so uninspiring until my eyes reached the following letter, a glyph which could be generously described as "the blandest 'l' in history".

But nothing quite screams corporate professionalism like the upturned, lemonade-stand-esque 'e' which stands proudly askew, terminating both the end of the word and your trust in the company.

I say go back to the old days, make a strong artistic statement, and bring back <a href="/images/google-1997.jpg">this WordArt classic</a>. This is your opportunity to be a trend-setter Google, seize this moment now.

But regardless of what you will read today about Google's fresh look, at least we can all agree it's better than Spotify's new green.
