If you happen to frequent a small corner of the web called Google (found <a href="http://www.google.com">here</a>) you may have noticed that things look a little different today:

Yes, Google has eschewed their iconic serifed emblem for a bolder, more simplified logo. And what better way to evoke messaging for your information company than to use the font which looks like a preschoolers's handwriting?

Following a corporate restructuring under parent company 'Alphabet', Google's new childish logo was unveiled in faux-crayon in their classic building-blocks colours.

One can only wonder what is happening at Google but I thought I'd take a look at this new indictment to typography.

It begins with a bold and capital 'G' &mdash; a statement that says "Who needs brand recognition when you can replace the most iconic 'G' in history with the Groupon logo?"

Immediately following, and impeccably kerned, stand a couple of lowercase 'o's. A testament to flat design and Illustrator's Circle tool.

Google has forgone their lowercase-yet-dignified lobed '<span style="font-family:serif; font-size:1.2em;">g</span>' for the much simpler 'second-grade kind'. Never had I seen anything so uninspiring until my eyes reached the following letter, which could be generously described as "the blandest 'l' in history".

But nothing quite screams corporate professionalism like the upturned, lemonade-stand-esque 'e' which stands proudly askew, terminating both the end of the word and your trust in the company.

I say go back to the old days, make a strong artistic statement, and bring back <a href="/images/google-1997.jpg">this WordArt classic</a>.

But regardless of what you will read today about Google's fresh look, at least we can all agree it's better than Spotify's new green.
